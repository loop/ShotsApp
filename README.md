# Shots App

This is a simple (very very bare bones) application that showcases some simple animations in **Swift**.

This was made using a tutorial from [Design+Code](http://designcode.io).

<sub>This is very basic and doesn't have many features at all. It was made during a learning process and is kept here for reference.</sub>
